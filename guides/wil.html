            <h2>WHAT I'VE LEARNED 1</h2><br>
            <p>
                Making music is more important. Period.<br><br>

                It is not your cover art. Its not your followers. Its not your next collab or the number of plays per track or even the reacts per post on social media.<br><br>

                When I was younger, I could barely average 5 streams a month. I was bad at singing. I threw power chords at the wall. 
                My drummer sounded like he was playing in an alleyway on tin cans because our mics sucked. I sucked at mixing. I did not deserve people's time and attention.<br><br>

                Today, I can say I was accepted into Berklee, fresh from getting my high school diploma. My music promotes itself when I let it. 
                How? I played my guitar and my friend's drums throughout middle school. I sang my heart out for years. I picked up bass, then cello, 
                then pedals and fx processing, then synths and piano, then djing, then the flute, trumpet, violin, steel percussion... I live and breath music.<br><br>

                Everything else will follow when the music you push holds value. Not because you're proud of putting in the absolute bare minimum. That will never carry you.<br><br>

                Success will come when your song makes other people feel. 11-6-2023</p><br><hr>

            <h2>WHAT I'VE LEARNED 2</h2><br>
            <p> If you are still learning how to make music, why would you promote it?<br><br>

                I have a rule. My idols in music are odd for the music I produce. Soundgarden, McBaise, Ginger Root, The Dear Hunter, Feed Me Jack, Destrage, Foo Fighters, Lie and A Chameleon... 
                If I listen to my finished songs and impatiently switch off to #artists I otherwise listen to in my spare time, I know my song requires work. If I publish it now, I have failed. 
                Why would anyone support my work if it doesn't meet my own standards?<br><br>

                Content comes AFTER you have a marketable idea. No exceptions.<br><br>

                Lets say we have music that's finally great. Our family and friends are no longer going "That sounds so good, honey". No, they're like woah, hold on. Where did this come from? 
                "I'm actually impressed." That hallmark silence and not just the forced chair wiggle. That's awesome. Take an hour or 2 to feel good about yourself because you deserve it.<br><br>

                Now you have what is explicitly known as a product. One worth selling, at that. Music may not be your entire brand, but it will buy you leverage. Leverage with promoters, 
                in call to action with fans, when reaching out to new listeners... I know. FINALLY. The whole "I don't have to do EVERYTHING for ONCE in my life." moment.<br><br>

                Quick tip: Earn your share. Provide value to your followers instead of posting memes on your business page and complaining about the algorithm ignoring you. 11-13-2023</p><br><hr>

            <h2>WEEKLY WHAT I'VE LEARNED 3</h2><br>
            <p>A quality mixdown serves a purpose.<br><br>

                Personally, I wish to appeal to people who listen to metal, dubstep, pop, and progressive rock. As a consequence, my rails, or lack thereof, are set by the parts of my favorite 
                albums that make me say "Oh. That thing they did makes a lot of sense. I want to do that in THIS song."<br><br>

                To achieve this, my #music has entire tracks that sound like the master is distorted to high hell and back, but its all in the processing. I will take my sub bass, duplicate it, 
                add white noise, add convolution, and slam it with a saturator just to turn the output down -20db and waveshape it for hang time. It pushes -2db on the fader by the way. 
                However, I don't "mix quiet". I produce in a DAW, or <b>Digital</b> Audio Workshop setting. Clipping is a non-destructive function of the environment.<br><br>

                LUFs are a rule of measurement, not a number to exceed. Maybe you're in a metal/rock band or produce for one like I do. Don't discredit what I'm about to share because it 
                applies to you as well.<br><br>

                If you want to be as loud as Svdden Death, ok. You only really need -3rms on your drop to be competitive in #EDM. I only encourage learning how to reach that because it will 
                teach you why dubstep production sounds the way it does. A lot of the #loudness measure comes from the sustained volume of your sub juxtaposed against your mids and highs.<br><br>

                Now lets break down the case use for LUFs. If I am writing a synthpop track, maybe i wouldnt want my sub playing legato for 3 consecutive minutes. I might achieve -5lufs 
                in the chorus and -11lufs on average. The song is still blaring in the chorus. It sounds good. It is dynamic and punchy.<br><br>

                Your mixdown is good.<br><br>

                Next time a label denies you for your mix or you're upset that it sounds quiet on streaming platforms, ask yourself if you would still promote this song if 
                someone else made it.<br><br>

                Thank you for reading. Stay focused. By now, the pieces of the puzzle should be showing themselves. If they were already present, this is your sign to pick them back up.

            <h2>WEEKLY WHAT I'VE LEARNED 4</h2><br>
            <p>Money is inertia. Reciprocity is momentum.<br><br>

                You can't buy respect, and I can not stress this enough. You may lack engagement from potential fans. It's ok. You're still making progress.
                There's a chance that a solid promo campaign will get you a few thousand #clicks. If you don't get that organically, its not your time to advertise. Some people lose 
                money doing these repost chains or playlist features out of pocket. Don't be that person.<br><br>

                Regarding music and money, people will play songs they like ad nauseam. These are songs that the worst promoter can flip without lifting a finger. 
                I will regularly see some friends and strangers alike playing my songs 5-18 times on release day. That's our cue to jump. To put an example to this, I will have albums 
                that i listen to front to back weekly for years. I promote those songs for free and You likely have artists you do the same for. If you are not experiencing this 
                engagement from your friends and early fans, save your money for a while.<br><br>

                If you do get repeat listens from multiple people, it is time to start leveraging reciprocity. People you pay time and attention to will be more inclined to listen 
                to a new song you published because you were listening when nobody else was. Right? Right. Take action. It works. You may be here reading my posts for that exact reason, 
                and I can not thank you enough for your time. You keep me looking forward to the future and happy in my present.<br><br>

                For what its worth, Direct Messaging is terribly underutilized on pay to win platforms like oh, i dont know, meta facebook? Soundcloud? Instagram? oh what about Google? 
                Bluesky? Maybe Reddit? yeah. This is where you can take your friends list and run a test launch. Your "book" of contacts can waive the $8 cpm, per ad you may pay when 
                starting off. Ads have no value until you have everything to gain from your expenditure.<br><br>

                Focus on the people who bring you today's success and continue to provide quality for tomorrow. 11-27-2023</p><br><hr>

            <h2>WEEKLY WHAT I'VE LEARNED 5</h2><br>
            <p>Audience Retention.<br><br>

                Thriller. Graduation. Nevermind. Discovery. Literally everything that came after.<br>
                Writers back in the day had to compete with monumental names to convince labels that 
                some group of 19 yr olds had "IT". They did not focus on "intros" and "outros." They INTRODUCED riffs. They INTRODUCED a chorus. Golden era producers valued a listener's 
                time and money. Keep it on point.<br><br>

                My listener retention and overnight plays increased exponentially when I started getting to the point in 2 bars or less; roughly 6 seconds or sooner. I previously bought 
                the idea of the intro/build concept because i wanted to get on labels. Now, no genre stans will accept me into their cliques. Its only listeners. I tried to meet label 
                standards for a few years and one of the most dumbfounding critiques I got was how these people love when the sub bass only plays in the drop. like, what?<br><br>
                
                People have been conditioned to skip half of your song. <b>Doesn't this bother you?</b><br><br>

                Ever since I've rediscovered writing music like a listener, I exist outside the cycle of making a song, begging for label approval, settling, promoting the song on the 
                owner's behalf, buying accessory promotion to compensate for the label's 1 hitter repost chain, sacrificing repoir to get 1 solitary play... 1 measly click through. 
                Now I hit up people in the dms at any time and show em a song from 3 months ago that has had linear engagement since release. The plays on my pages compound with every release.<br><br>

                TRIGGER WARNING: If you think the platform you use stopped promoting your music (instead of people finding someone dedicated to writing more enjoyable music), 
                don't read this next part.<br>
                -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                You are most likely writing pop music, also known as rap, r&b, electronic, rock, indie, god knows what else - and your audience can not sing the instrumental.<br><br>

                That is insane. Scrap it.<br><br>

                Is your verse ambient by contract? Plagarize a videogame score. I do not care. Let the melody sing in the background.<br>
                Put the work in to make a unique second verse following the drop or chorus. You will only publish this song once.<br>
                If there is downtime longer than 4 bars, scrap it.<br>
                Need a build? conDENSE THE BUILD IN TO the VERSE. Make it musical.<br>
                A drop is comparable to a written guitar solo. Do not copy/paste.<br>
                Choruses? I love a good chorus. It better be of similar quality to your verse, tho.<br>
                Outros? They do not belong on your spotify release unless they are quotable or engaging.<br><br>

                Got it? Sick. I'm more annoyed talking about this than you may be annoyed with me for saying it.<br><br>

                Quit wasting your listener's time. Pick up the keyboard. Fix your shit.<br>
                ------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>

                Thank you for coming again. I know who will blink at this and keep making tearout or whatever trends next. To the rest of you, message me on any platform. 
                I started making music because, going all the way back to 2011, there is still a void that few people are filling. I have dedicated 13 years now to the skill of 
                actualizing the music I need in my world. I would hate to die one day and have this gatekept information disappear into the void. Why? Because some of you reading 
                these posts have a goal in mind.<br><br>

            <h2>WEEKLY WHAT I'VE LEARNED 6</h2><br>
            <p>Take a break. You (probably don't) need (want) it.<br><br>
                
               If your friends go cold, you may have been working too long. If your friends don't talk to you anymore BECAUSE you worked for too long, they're not your friends.
               Another good rule of thumb, btw, is to recognize that people who call on the daily (probably) aren't career producers. I talk to a lot of these guys, albeit briefly, 
               and the adults in chat who do nothing but gossip and play video games will tell you out loud that they're waiting for a break or they're too busy for one reason or 
               another. If you feel offended, I'm (probably) not talking about you. If you're still convinced that this is a call out, why? You know what's up. I'm touch starved, 
               isolated, greying in my 20s, never happy when I'm winning, never satisfied when I meet my goals, haven't been in a relationship in 2 years, have nobody to relate to 
               beyond the fact that I'm bad at communicating in groups because i refuse to accept a mediocre life... go have sex with your s/o or hug your kids. You don't want what I'm 
               going through. If you wanted this life bad enough, you'd be alone too.<br><br>

            <h2>WEEKLY WHAT I'VE LEARNED 7</h2><br>
            <p>@here, @everyone<br><br>

                Are people annoyed about push notifications? This means the updates are not providing value to your audience.<br>
                It means that the livestream sucks. My merch sucks or is overpriced for my perceived value, which also means that my music is not good enough for the price I'm charging. 
                Worst case scenario - the music sucks.<br><br>

                There's two ways to combat annoyance from fans.<br><br>

                One way which I have spent the past 6 weeks screaming from the rooftops about is to fix your music. I did it. It works. I helped other people do it multiple times. 
                It works for them, too. To date. Continuously. Still, some people might also hang in my crowd to poach listeners. Are they succeeding? Cool. Now I have to work as hard 
                as he/she did to earn my listeners loyalty. That's how this works until you're past "hype music". Make such a niche version of what you used to do that people can no 
                longer predict your next move.<br><br>

                A second viable and effective method is to stop leading the group and start talking to the individual. You are speaking to someone who works 40 hours a week. 
                They require food. They don't always get perfect sleep. They lose family and friends. They share sentiment with things that only make sense for them. They have their 
                own dreams too. Reach out in private if this person's attention is important to you. I guarantee they've been watching you scream about your art for as long as you've 
                been forgetting their name.<br><br>

                Stop using @everyone until what you are announcing positively affects everyone. 12-18-2023</p><br><hr>

            <h2>WEEKLY WHAT I'VE LEARNED 8</h2><br>
            <p>It's almost been 2 months since I said that the #music we sell is the only priority. If this is not your truth, bookmark this post and come back when the MP3 gets 
                more #shares than the soundcloud link. I promise you this happens once you get off social media.<br><br>

                I view song titles and album covers as a barrier to entry for all music. They communicate the most information about the song in the least amount of time.<br><br>

                Art is a double-edged blade. If your art tells people you are serious but the song sucks, the payoff for clicking your song is negative points. Say goodbye to that 
                listener for at least 8 months. If the art is unappealing but the music is good (loompaskette), you will have to fight harder for the initial stream. You will, 
                however, keep everyone on the other side of the play button. <br><br>

                On social media platforms like Soundcloud or YouTube, you have the freedom of naming your song anything in the world. Choose a title that can be googled. Also, 
                consider making a title that makes people look twice. On release, my songs may get a title like "womp womp say goodbye to your toenails" and have some eerie, tonally 
                appropriate, dreamcore image off of Google and then get switched to "Hangnail" with the commissioned cover art after I reach 1k streams.<br><br>

                After you reward people for taking the clickbait, strangers now abide by a different social contract known as #curiosity. "Why does this song have 1k streams?" 
                followed by "Why doesn't this song have 10k streams?" and so on.<br><br>

                Back to the very first thing I said; none of this matters until your music is worthy of plays. Nothing is free. Listeners pay us in attention. We're exchanging 
                that attention with dopamine and memories. That is a reason why performing and writing music is a business. That's why I get paid for my work.<br><br>

            <h2>WEEKLY WHAT I'VE LEARNED 9</h2><br>
            <p>#Criticism is a reflection of those who criticize.<br><br>

                Effective feedback is neither good nor bad. I could choose to let my ego decide that a person doesn't like me for not liking my work in progress, but that would 
                be a failure to listen. We're writing for other people, and if you aren't, why are you here? This is about marketing. Need to learn music theory and sound engineering? 
                Go join my server instead. I have $$$ worth of privatized information written by myself and uploaded for free.<br><br>

                Lets say someone offers aimless or loaded criticism.<br><br>

                "vocals bad" - take the hint.<br><br>

                "your drums suck" - what about them? is it the sound of my snare? is the sidechain not working? is the sub bow-tying from my kick? are the hihats too quiet? are they 
                too busy? too empty?<br><br>

                Some people don't have time to articulate the full idea. Some just can't, but they know how the music makes them feel. If you can ask all this, it might actually be 
                harder to find peers to critique your demos. You might have to start listening to yourself instead. I used to offer feedback streams every sunday to make up for that, 
                but my core audience sought topics like this instead. I took my own advice and accepted their feedback. I'm more proud of this in all honesty.<br><br>

                There is still a process to taking feedback constructively. If you haven't developed that mentality of people working toward a "common cause", it's time to start. 
                I say all the time that I teach/critique so I can have good music to listen to. Thats why I teach for free.<br><br>

                A warning: People who only listen to their "homies" demonstrate a failure of the prefrontal cortex. This self-destructive behavior is on par with drunk driving. 
                Run from these people because their "inner circle" trades around like a deck of cards on poker night.<br><br>

                While there will be the occasional shit talker, even hate is based in honesty. Learn to listen for the truth and you will go farther. Farther than anyone you may ever know.<br><br>

                I don't expect this one to perform well with anyone. It's too personal for some, common sense for others... The rare few people who want to hear this kind of thing are so 
                hardcore that they're probably on day 569 of eating bread sandwhiches and muscle milk and doing isometric training at an abandoned elementary school while their omega 
                dommy mommy goth s/o sinks next months paycheck into a fursuit because furries ball out. mfs got money to spend and they know how to get that bag do not let anyone tell you otherwise.</p><br><hr>

            <p><b>Think like a listener.</b><br><br>

                part 1 - selling music<br><br>

                Are you struggling to get plays? Your #fans aren't. They know exactly what to put on when they want #music. I'd bet you do, too.<br><br>

                Albums build #loyalty through exposure. The singles game is most effective for brand awareness, but you won't always need daily #exposure. Play the long game and come out on top.<br><br>

                Free #album downloads work. Download "DL Gate" gates do not. 2 steps or less. I'll talk more on this next week, but here's why sites like #Bandcamp are effective and valuable.<br><br>

                Email funneling.<br><br>
                If your fans are broke today, snag their email in exchange for offline downloads. Smartphones can unzip compressed files and look just like spotify without the $180/year barrier. 
                Oh, and would you look at that? Instead of your fans paying you .89c a year in royalties, they can put that $15 back in your pocket via shirts or beanies because you are now their 
                most played #artist offline. They are biting their nails in hopes they can grab a ticket to your small #show before they run out. Neat!<br><br>

                Exposure.<br><br>

                Free, unobtrusive, music downloads make fans out of passive listeners. I don't know that I'll have an interest in someone until I know they exist. Likewise, I don't end up crushing 
                on a girl unless I'm around them enough to know I like them. Now, by all means, kill your growth potential and put those walls up. Same deal if someone I enjoyed the company of 
                consistently shut me down when I try to hang out, I can take the hint.<br><br>

                If the money matters that much, make some CDs and learn how to ship. jewel cases are cheap. printing is cheap. making a 2-sided album cover and some booklets is brain-dead simple. 
                Bonus points if you include the materials as a .PDF in case the fans need to replace these things later. Talk to your postal services in the area and find one that suits your supply 
                and demand. see how they handle shipping and add it into the cost of operations. Sneak some CDs into your local goodwill, convince your record stores to take a stack at discount, and so on.<br><br>
                Think like a listener.<br><br>

I'm finishing this one around 4am on the floor because the hotel bed is too hot. Weird week, but I'm having fun. As much as I'd love to talk more on this topic, these things need room to breath. DM me on here, insta, snap, twitter, discord if you have more questions. It may be a month or longer until part 2.
