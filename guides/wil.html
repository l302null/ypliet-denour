        <p>
            Making music is more important. Period.<br><br>

            It is not your cover art. Its not your followers. Its not your next collab or the number of plays per track or even the reacts per post on social media.<br><br>

            When I was younger, I could barely average 5 streams a month. I was bad at singing. I threw power chords at the wall. 
            My drummer sounded like he was playing in an alleyway on tin cans because our mics sucked. I sucked at mixing. I did not deserve people's time and attention.<br><br>

            Today, I can say I was accepted into Berklee, fresh from getting my high school diploma. My music promotes itself when I let it. 
            How? I played my guitar and my friend's drums throughout middle school. I sang my heart out for years. I picked up bass, then cello, 
            then pedals and fx processing, then synths and piano, then djing, then the flute, trumpet, violin, steel percussion... I live and breath music.<br><br>

            Everything else will follow when the music you push holds value. Not because you're proud of putting in the absolute bare minimum. That will never carry you.<br><br>

            Success will come when your song makes other people feel.

        <h2>WHAT I'VE LEARNED 2</h2><br>
        <p> If you are still learning how to make music, why would you promote it?<br><br>

            I have a rule. My idols in music are odd for the music I produce. Soundgarden, McBaise, Ginger Root, The Dear Hunter, Feed Me Jack, Destrage, Foo Fighters, Lie and A Chameleon... 
            If I listen to my finished songs and impatiently switch off to #artists I otherwise listen to in my spare time, I know my song requires work. If I publish it now, I have failed. 
            Why would anyone support my work if it doesn't meet my own standards?<br><br>

            Content comes AFTER you have a marketable idea. No exceptions.<br><br>

            Lets say we have music that's finally great. Our family and friends are no longer going "That sounds so good, honey". No, they're like woah, hold on. Where did this come from? 
            "I'm actually impressed." That hallmark silence and not just the forced chair wiggle. That's awesome. Take an hour or 2 to feel good about yourself because you deserve it.<br><br>

            Now you have what is explicitly known as a product. One worth selling, at that. Music may not be your entire brand, but it will buy you leverage. Leverage with promoters, 
            in call to action with fans, when reaching out to new listeners... I know. FINALLY. The whole "I don't have to do EVERYTHING for ONCE in my life." moment.<br><br>

            Quick tip: Earn your share. Provide value to your followers instead of posting memes on your business page and complaining about the algorithm ignoring you.</p><br><hr>

        <h2>WEEKLY WHAT I'VE LEARNED 3</h2><br>
        <p>A quality mixdown serves a purpose.<br><br>

            Personally, I wish to appeal to people who listen to metal, dubstep, pop, and progressive rock. As a consequence, my rails, or lack thereof, are set by the parts of my favorite 
            albums that make me say "Oh. That thing they did makes a lot of sense. I want to do that in THIS song."<br><br>

            To achieve this, my #music has entire tracks that sound like the master is distorted to high hell and back, but its all in the processing. I will take my sub bass, duplicate it, 
            add white noise, add convolution, and slam it with a saturator just to turn the output down -20db and waveshape it for hang time. It pushes -2db on the fader by the way. 
            However, I don't "mix quiet". I produce in a DAW, or <b>Digital</b> Audio Workshop setting. Clipping is a non-destructive function of the environment.<br><br>

            LUFs are a rule of measurement, not a number to exceed. Maybe you're in a metal/rock band or produce for one like I do. Don't discredit what I'm about to share because it 
            applies to you as well.<br><br>

            If you want to be as loud as Svdden Death, ok. You only really need -3rms on your drop to be competitive in #EDM. I only encourage learning how to reach that because it will 
            teach you why dubstep production sounds the way it does. A lot of the #loudness measure comes from the sustained volume of your sub juxtaposed against your mids and highs.<br><br>

            Now lets break down the case use for LUFs. If I am writing a synthpop track, maybe i wouldnt want my sub playing legato for 3 consecutive minutes. I might achieve -5lufs 
            in the chorus and -11lufs on average. The song is still blaring in the chorus. It sounds good. It is dynamic and punchy.<br><br>

            Your mixdown is good.<br><br>

            Next time a label denies you for your mix or you're upset that it sounds quiet on streaming platforms, ask yourself if you would still promote this song if 
            someone else made it.<br><br>

            Thank you for reading. Stay focused. By now, the pieces of the puzzle should be showing themselves. If they were already present, this is your sign to pick them back up.</p><br><hr>
