        <h2>WHAT I'VE LEARNED 2</h2><br>
        <p>
            Making music is more important. Period.<br><br>

            It is not your cover art. Its not your followers. Its not your next collab or the number of plays per track or even the reacts per post on social media.<br><br>

            When I was younger, I could barely average 5 streams a month. I was bad at singing. I threw power chords at the wall. 
            My drummer sounded like he was playing in an alleyway on tin cans because our mics sucked. I sucked at mixing. I did not deserve people's time and attention.<br><br>

            Today, I can say I was accepted into Berklee, fresh from getting my high school diploma. My music promotes itself when I let it. 
            How? I played my guitar and my friend's drums throughout middle school. I sang my heart out for years. I picked up bass, then cello, 
            then pedals and fx processing, then synths and piano, then djing, then the flute, trumpet, violin, steel percussion... I live and breath music.<br><br>

            Everything else will follow when the music you push holds value. Not because you're proud of putting in the absolute bare minimum. That will never carry you.<br><br>

            Success will come when your song makes other people feel.

        <h2>WHAT I'VE LEARNED 2</h2><br>
        <p> If you are still learning how to make music, why would you promote it?<br><br>

            I have a rule. My idols in music are odd for the music I produce. Soundgarden, McBaise, Ginger Root, The Dear Hunter, Feed Me Jack, Destrage, Foo Fighters, Lie and A Chameleon... 
            If I listen to my finished songs and impatiently switch off to #artists I otherwise listen to in my spare time, I know my song requires work. If I publish it now, I have failed. 
            Why would anyone support my work if it doesn't meet my own standards?<br><br>

            Content comes AFTER you have a marketable idea. No exceptions.<br><br>

            Lets say we have music that's finally great. Our family and friends are no longer going "That sounds so good, honey". No, they're like woah, hold on. Where did this come from? 
            "I'm actually impressed." That hallmark silence and not just the forced chair wiggle. That's awesome. Take an hour or 2 to feel good about yourself because you deserve it.<br><br>

            Now you have what is explicitly known as a product. One worth selling, at that. Music may not be your entire brand, but it will buy you leverage. Leverage with promoters, 
            in call to action with fans, when reaching out to new listeners... I know. FINALLY. The whole "I don't have to do EVERYTHING for ONCE in my life." moment.<br><br>

            Quick tip: Earn your share. Provide value to your followers instead of posting memes on your business page and complaining about the algorithm ignoring you.</p><br><hr>

        <h2>WEEKLY WHAT I'VE LEARNED 3</h2><br>
        <p>A quality mixdown serves a purpose.<br><br>

            Personally, I wish to appeal to people who listen to metal, dubstep, pop, and progressive rock. As a consequence, my rails, or lack thereof, are set by the parts of my favorite 
            albums that make me say "Oh. That thing they did makes a lot of sense. I want to do that in THIS song."<br><br>

            To achieve this, my #music has entire tracks that sound like the master is distorted to high hell and back, but its all in the processing. I will take my sub bass, duplicate it, 
            add white noise, add convolution, and slam it with a saturator just to turn the output down -20db and waveshape it for hang time. It pushes -2db on the fader by the way. 
            However, I don't "mix quiet". I produce in a DAW, or <b>Digital</b> Audio Workshop setting. Clipping is a non-destructive function of the environment.<br><br>

            LUFs are a rule of measurement, not a number to exceed. Maybe you're in a metal/rock band or produce for one like I do. Don't discredit what I'm about to share because it 
            applies to you as well.<br><br>

            If you want to be as loud as Svdden Death, ok. You only really need -3rms on your drop to be competitive in #EDM. I only encourage learning how to reach that because it will 
            teach you why dubstep production sounds the way it does. A lot of the #loudness measure comes from the sustained volume of your sub juxtaposed against your mids and highs.<br><br>

            Now lets break down the case use for LUFs. If I am writing a synthpop track, maybe i wouldnt want my sub playing legato for 3 consecutive minutes. I might achieve -5lufs 
            in the chorus and -11lufs on average. The song is still blaring in the chorus. It sounds good. It is dynamic and punchy.<br><br>

            Your mixdown is good.<br><br>

            Next time a label denies you for your mix or you're upset that it sounds quiet on streaming platforms, ask yourself if you would still promote this song if 
            someone else made it.<br><br>

            Thank you for reading. Stay focused. By now, the pieces of the puzzle should be showing themselves. If they were already present, this is your sign to pick them back up.</p><br><hr>

        <p>Money is inertia. Reciprocity is momentum.<br><br>

            You can't buy respect, and I can not stress this enough. You may lack engagement from potential fans. It's ok. You're still making progress.
            There's a chance that a solid promo campaign will get you a few thousand #clicks. If you don't get that organically, its not your time to advertise. Some people lose 
            money doing these repost chains or playlist features out of pocket. Don't be that person.<br><br>

            Regarding music and money, people will play songs they like ad nauseam. These are songs that the worst promoter can flip without lifting a finger. 
            I will regularly see some friends and strangers alike playing my songs 5-18 times on release day. That's our cue to jump. To put an example to this, I will have albums 
            that i listen to front to back weekly for years. I promote those songs for free and You likely have artists you do the same for. If you are not experiencing this 
            engagement from your friends and early fans, save your money for a while.<br><br>

            If you do get repeat listens from multiple people, it is time to start leveraging reciprocity. People you pay time and attention to will be more inclined to listen 
            to a new song you published because you were listening when nobody else was. Right? Right. Take action. It works. You may be here reading my posts for that exact reason, 
            and I can not thank you enough for your time. You keep me looking forward to the future and happy in my present.<br><br>

            For what its worth, Direct Messaging is terribly underutilized on pay to win platforms like oh, i dont know, meta facebook? Soundcloud? Instagram? oh what about Google? 
            Bluesky? Maybe Reddit? yeah. This is where you can take your friends list and run a test launch. Your "book" of contacts can waive the $8 cpm, per ad you may pay when 
            starting off. Ads have no value until you have everything to gain from your expenditure.<br><br>

            Focus on the people who bring you today's success and continue to provide quality for tomorrow.</p><br><hr>

        <p>Audience Retention.<br><br>

            Thriller. Graduation. Nevermind. Discovery. Literally everything that came after. Writers back in the day had to compete with monumental names to convince labels that 
            some group of 19 yr olds had "IT". They did not focus on "intros" and "outros." They INTRODUCED riffs. They INTRODUCED a chorus. Golden era producers valued a listener's 
            time and money. Keep it on point.<br><br>

            My listener retention and overnight plays increased exponentially when I started getting to the point in 2 bars or less; roughly 6 seconds or sooner. I previously bought 
            the idea of the intro/build concept because i wanted to get on labels. Now, no genre stans will accept me into their cliques. Its only listeners. I tried to meet label 
            standards for a few years and one of the most dumbfounding critiques I got was how these people love when the sub bass only plays in the drop. like, what? People have 
            been conditioned to skip half of your song. Doesn't this bother you?<br><br>

            Ever since I've rediscovered writing music like a listener, I exist outside the cycle of making a song, begging for label approval, settling, promoting the song on the 
            owner's behalf, buying accessory promotion to compensate for the label's 1 hitter repost chain, sacrificing repoir to get 1 solitary play... 1 measly click through. 
            Now I hit up people in the dms at any time and show em a song from 3 months ago that has had linear engagement since release. The plays on my pages compound with every release.<br><br>

            TRIGGER WARNING: If you think the platform you use stopped promoting your music (instead of people finding someone dedicated to writing more enjoyable music), 
            don't read this next part.<br>
            -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
            Here's where the blog ends and the actionable steps begin.<br><br>

            You are most likely writing pop music, also known as rap, r&b, electronic, rock, indie, god knows what else - and your audience can not sing the instrumental. That is insane. Scrap it.<br>
            Is your verse ambient by contract? Plagarize a videogame score. I do not care. Let the melody sing in the background.<br>
            Put the work in to make a unique second verse following the drop or chorus. You only get to publish this song once.<br>
            If there is downtime longer than 4 bars, scrap it.<br>
            Need a build? conDENSE THE BUILD IN TO the VERSE. Make it musical.<br>
            A drop is comparable to a written guitar solo. Do not copy/paste.<br>
            Choruses? I love a good chorus. It better be of similar quality to your verse, tho.<br>
            Outros? They do not belong on your spotify release unless they are quotable or engaging.<br><br>
            Got it? Sweet. I guarantee you I'm more annoyed talking about this than you may be annoyed with me for saying it.<br><br>
            Quit wasting your listeners' time, guys. Stop it. Just put down the keyboard and fix your shit.<br>
            ------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
            Thank you for coming again. I know who will blink at this and keep making tearout or whatever trends next. To the rest of you, message me on any platform. I started making music because, going all the way back to 2011, there is still a void that few people are filling. I have dedicated 13 years now to the skill of actualizing the music I need in my world. I would hate to die one day and have this gatekept information disappear into the void. Why? Because some of you reading these posts have that same thirst. I haven't seen anyone else come around with that kool aid on tap.
